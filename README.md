## Overview

**winbind** is a D library for generating runtime bindings to Windows APIs or libraries, based on models of `extern(C)` functions. It enables dynamic interoperability between D code and native Windows libraries by producing bindings at runtime.

---

## Features

- **Automatic Runtime Binding**  
  Dynamically generate D bindings for Windows APIs using `extern(C)` function models.

- **Windows Platform Support**  
  Specifically designed for Windows, conforming to platform conventions.

- **Pure D Implementation**  
  Written entirely in D, making integration with D projects seamless.

## Usage

Add bind.d to your project. Add `import winbind.bind;` to the files that will use it.
